The id Attribute

The id attribute specifies a unique id for an HTML element. The value of the id attribute must be unique within the HTML document.

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<style>
#myHeader {
  background-color: lightblue;
  color: black;
  padding: 40px;
  text-align: center;
}
</style>
</head>
<body>

<h1 id="myHeader">My Header</h1>

</body>
</html>

Difference Between Class and ID
A class name can be used by multiple HTML elements, while an id name must only be used by one HTML element within the page:

HTML Bookmarks with ID and Links
HTML bookmarks are used to allow readers to jump to specific parts of a webpage.

Bookmarks can be useful if your page is very long.

To use a bookmark, you must first create it, and then add a link to it.

Then, when the link is clicked, the page will scroll to the location with the bookmark.

Example
First, create a bookmark with the id attribute:

<h2 id="C4">Chapter 4</h2>
Then, add a link to the bookmark ("Jump to Chapter 4"), from within the same page:

Example
<a href="#C4">Jump to Chapter 4</a>
Or, add a link to the bookmark ("Jump to Chapter 4"), from another page:

<a href="html_demo.html#C4">Jump to Chapter 4</a>
