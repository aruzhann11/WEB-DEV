The HTML <map> tag defines an image map. An image map is an image with clickable areas. The areas are defined with one or more <area> tags.

Here is the HTML source code for the image map above:

<img src="workplace.jpg" alt="Workplace" usemap="#workmap">

<map name="workmap">
  <area shape="rect" coords="34,44,270,350" alt="Computer" href="computer.htm">
  <area shape="rect" coords="290,172,333,250" alt="Phone" href="phone.htm">
  <area shape="circle" coords="337,300,44" alt="Coffee" href="coffee.htm">
</map>


The <map> element is used to create an image map, and is linked to the image by using the required name attribute:

<map name="workmap">

Then, add the clickable areas.

A clickable area is defined using an <area> element.

Shape
You must define the shape of the clickable area, and you can choose one of these values:

rect - defines a rectangular region
circle - defines a circular region
poly - defines a polygonal region
default - defines the entire region

<area shape="rect" coords="34, 44, 270, 350" href="computer.htm">
