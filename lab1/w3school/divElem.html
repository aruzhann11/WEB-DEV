The <div> element is by default a block element, meaning that it takes all available width, and comes with line breaks before and after.

    Lorem Ipsum <div>I am a div</div> dolor sit amet.

    <div> as a container
The <div> element is often used to group sections of a web page together.

Example
A <div> element with HTML elements:

<div>
  <h2>London</h2>
  <p>London is the capital city of England.</p>
  <p>London has over 9 million inhabitants.</p>
</div>

Center align a <div> element
If you have a <div> element that is not 100% wide, and you want to center-align it, set the CSS margin property to auto.

Example
<style>
div {
  width:300px;
  margin:auto;
}
</style>

Multiple <div> elements
You can have many <div> containers on the same page.

Example
<div>
  <h2>London</h2>
  <p>London is the capital city of England.</p>
  <p>London has over 9 million inhabitants.</p>
</div>

<div>
  <h2>Oslo</h2>
  <p>Oslo is the capital city of Norway.</p>
  <p>Oslo has over 700,000 inhabitants.</p>
</div>

<div>
  <h2>Rome</h2>
  <p>Rome is the capital city of Italy.</p>
  <p>Rome has over 4 million inhabitants.</p>
</div>
