HSL Color Values
In HTML, a color can be specified using hue, saturation, and lightness (HSL) in the form:

hsl(hue, saturation, lightness)

Saturation
Saturation can be described as the intensity of a color.

100% is pure color, no shades of gray.

50% is 50% gray, but you can still see the color.

0% is completely gray; you can no longer see the color.

Example

hsl(0, 80%, 50%)
hsl(0, 60%, 50%)
hsl(0, 40%, 50%)
